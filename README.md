# TravellerWorldExplain

Playing with MAUI and seeing if I can create an Android app. 
Just because it seems like an interesting idea.

## Planned Phases
### Phase 1
Get the basic I/O in place, screen layout - done!
### Phase 2
Get the "explain" button to work:
* classic trade codes
* expand out on the stats and what they mean
### Phase 3
* basic trade stuff - cargo, freight, passengers
### Phase 4
* see about using TravellerMap's APIs to allow users to search & load planets at will
### Phase 5
* who knows...
